Run ```python fakeNews.py```

#### Requirements:
This script depends on OpenWPM (https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM), please follow the installation process here (https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM#installation) and simply execute the fakeNews.py script. Change the list of 'sites' in the script to scrape different levels/websites.
